    desc: 'Post-weaning depression is a term used to describe depression that can occur after a lactating individual stops breastfeeding. It can come as a result of hormonal fluctuations as well as the psychological stress of weaning. Unfortunately, lactating individuals are not always closely monitored for depression at the time of weaning, says David Goldstein, M.D., an OB-GYN based in Philadelphia. \n \n Dr. Saltz adds that despite some increased awareness, post-weaning depression remains less familiar to the psychiatric community than other postpartum conditions. Most people who have given birth are screened on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale at their postpartum visits, and their OB-GYN might discuss possible symptoms of postpartum depression and anxiety at that time. But checkup usually happens at around six weeks postpartum and does not account for the fact that some people may wean sooner or even much later. \n \n It can be challenging to identify post-weaning depression, but if you are having symptoms and have recently weaned in the past few weeks or even months, you should mention it to a doctor. Anyone dealing with post-weaning symptoms can get in touch with a mental health professional, general physician, or OB-GYN who will help determine the best course of treatment.',

    desc: 'The early days of pregnancy can bring an onslaught of symptoms such as nausea, breast tenderness, and fatigue—not to mention a rollercoaster of emotions. For some, these new body changes lead to one of the most frustrating side effects of pregnancy: insomnia. A common sleep disorder, insomnia refers to challenges with falling asleep, staying asleep, or getting a quality night’s sleep. \n \n If tossing, turning, or staring at the ceiling have replaced your once-peaceful night, try not to be too hard on yourself—you’re growing a tiny human, after all! But in the meantime, we’ll take a closer look at why insomnia happens in early pregnancy and how to cope with your newfound lack of sleep. In early pregnancy, you can blame your hormones for not being able to fall asleep,” explains Rachel Mitchell, a certified Pediatric and Maternity Sleep Consultant and founder of My Sweet Sleeper. The sudden surge of hormones like human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) and progesterone can bring their fair share of side effects, which explains why you’re feeling so off during those first weeks of pregnancy—ultimately leading to a poor night’s sleep. \n \n A rise in hCG is often associated with nausea and vomiting in early pregnancy, which are two symptoms that can also play a role in disrupted sleep.2 And although progesterone can make you sleepy during the day, it can also cause sleep fragmentation at night, says Brandon Peters, M.D., a board-certified Sleep Physician at Virginia Mason Medical Center and the author of Sleep Through Insomnia. \n \n Increased urinary frequency, back pain, breast tenderness, increased appetite, and anxiety may all cause trouble sleeping during the first trimester,” he adds. \n \n Mitchell notes that contrary to its name, morning sickness—a common early sign of pregnancy—can happen at any point of the day, which can also cause sleep disruptions. Of course, any discomfort you feel during pregnancy can potentially lead to a poor night’s sleep. Ultimately, when you’re not feeling well, it can affect your ability to sleep,says Mitchell. ',

Despite it being relatively common, FGR isn’t a condition often discussed, especially in parent groups. \n \n A small baby isn't always an issue in itself—some babies may just be constitutionally small.

    desc: "My water broke at 31+6 weeks and our little one arrived eight weeks premature by emergency C-section. My doctors never confirmed what caused my FGR, although there were suspicions that my placenta either didn't implant properly, or had slightly detached during pregnancy. My son spent five weeks in NICU, mostly to build his strength as he was born below the 3rd percentile. Anticipating this was helpful, and I'm grateful to my medical team for preparing me for such outcomes. \n \n After birth, babies who were diagnosed with FGR may face some additional challenges. Post NICU, for example, my son experienced some feeding issues. That’s not uncommon for infants with FGR, as they may have issues tolerating typical feeding volumes once they're born, says Cuyler Romeo, M.O.T., OTR/L, SCFES, IBCLC, a feeding specialist at Feeding Matters. \n \n My son also had minor delays with gross motor skills, like crawling and walking, because he needed a bit longer to build his core muscles. But more than once his pediatric team told me he was bright as a button” and that there was nothing to worry about developmentally. \n \n By 12 months, he was up to the 9th percentile for weight and a huge 50th for length, making him tall-ish, but slight-ish, and very confidently healthy. Importantly, he continues to follow his growth curve. This is a far cry from the scenarios we were preparing for during our pregnancy, but will hopefully offer some comfort to those who are confused by their diagnosis like I was. \n \n How to Understand Infant Growth Charts: \n Romeo says although many children who were diagnosed with FGR catch up by the time they are 2 years old, some may need specialized support in different areas to ensure they reach their growth and developmental potential. \n \n This is not an indication of a future problem or delay, rather even more reason to empower families to seek support so they can make informed choices regarding their child's care,  she explains. They will learn new skills and meet their milestones; they will do so at the rate that works best for their unique body. ",

    desc: "When a fertilized egg implants in the uterus, which usually happens 10 to 14 days after conception, it sometimes causes part of the uterine lining to shed. When this occurs, it results in implantation bleeding, which can be one of the earliest signs of pregnancy. \n \n But here's the frustrating part: The blood that's released is nearly indistinguishable from normal spotting or breakthrough bleeding that can occur mid-cycle—especially in people who are on birth control pills or have polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). \n \n Unfortunately, knowing what spotting looks like doesn't usually help you distinguish it from implantation bleeding. So, how do you know if what you're seeing is implantation bleeding vs period bleeding? \n \n The only surefire way to tell the difference is to take a pregnancy test.  People are so anxious about knowing whether or not they're pregnant, they want to have definitive signs to look for, but unfortunately, only time will tell,  says Anuja Vyas, M.D., FACOG, with Houston Methodist Obstetrics and Gynecology Associates. \n \n That said, certain symptoms can offer hints that you could be experiencing implantation bleeding rather than period-related spotting. Spotting usually means just a few, well, spots of blood on your underwear or toilet tissue. Some experts claim spotting that starts brown or wine-colored and becomes a brighter red is most likely the start of your period. But George Patounakis, M.D., Ph.D., FACOG, a fertility specialist in Florida, says Googling pictures won't help if you're wondering if your bleeding is due to implantation.  There's no way to tell the difference between intermenstrual bleeding and implantation bleeding just by looking. \n \n To determine whether you have implantation bleeding or your period, you should pay attention to the following three symptoms and characteristics instead.",

    desc: "A blighted ovum happens when your body thinks it's pregnant, but no baby is forming. Learn about symptoms, causes, prevention, and more.With a blighted ovum, an egg is fertilized, prompting the body to pave the way for a baby by pumping out pregnancy hormones and forming the gestational sac and placenta. For some reason, though, the developmental process gets disrupted and the fertilized egg never develops into an embryo, leaving a fully formed gestational sac and potentially all the symptoms of pregnancy—but no developing embryo.A blighted ovum may result from a poor-quality sperm or egg, or it may occur due to abnormal cell division. But in many cases, an anembryonic pregnancy is caused by a chromosomal abnormality, says Octavia Cannon, D.O., an OB-GYN with Alliance Obstetrics & Gynecology in East Lansing, Michigan. There isn't always a clear explanation, but blighted ova are not caused by anything the biological parents did before or after conception. Blighted ova are quite common. Dr. Cannon notes that blighted ovum is the cause behind a staggering 50% of first-trimester miscarriages. And considering that 10% to 20% of all known pregnancies end in miscarriage—and more than 80% happen in the first trimester—that's not a small number. If the blighted ovum results in a very early miscarriage, you may not even know you were pregnant. Other times, the pregnancy continues long enough that you get a positive pregnancy test and even experience some early pregnancy symptoms. \n \n Because of the nature of anembryonic pregnancy, symptoms of a blighted ovum can include both early pregnancy symptoms (such as a missed period, positive pregnancy test, breast tenderness, and even morning sickness) and symptoms of early miscarriage (such as abdominal cramping and vaginal bleeding). \n \n Prior to your first ultrasound, you may be unaware that you have a blighted ovum since the empty gestational sac and placenta continue to give off hormones that make your body think it's pregnant. When an embryo doesn't form and the level of those hormones eventually begins to drop, however, pregnancy symptoms may fade and you may experience signs of miscarriage.",

    title: 'Can You Notice Signs of Implantation After Conceiving?',
    desc: "People who are trying to conceive often pay extra attention to their bodies, searching for any sign that implantation has occurred. But can you actually tell when implantation is happening? In other words, are there signs that the fertilized egg is implanting into the uterine lining, signaling the start of a pregnancy? The short answer is no—at least in regard to physical symptoms alone. \n \n That said, your body might still hint that implantation has happened. For example, some people experience spotting or cramps, and these symptoms can be related to implantation, says Dr. Hou. Here's what you need to know about the most common signs of implantation, and what they can tell you about conception.For conception to occur, the ovaries must first release a mature egg during ovulation. The egg gets fertilized by sperm in the reproductive tract, then it journeys to your uterus through the fallopian tubes. \n \n Implantation is when the fertilized egg implants itself into the uterine lining and starts to construct the placenta and embryo, says Dr. Hou. It happens one to two weeks after ovulation, and it indicates the beginning of a pregnancy. Some people notice signs of implantation as the fertilized egg implants into the uterine lining. The most common are cramping and bleeding, but they tend to be very subtle. Indeed, implantation symptoms can sometimes be confused with early menstruation, which can be vague and nonspecific, according to Chloe Acevedo, M.D., an OB-GYN at Atlantic Medical Group Women's Health in New Jersey.  The only way to confirm if symptoms are due to implantation or PMS is with a pregnancy test. \n \n Also, what some people consider  implantation symptoms  might actually be premenstrual symptoms. Some examples are sore breasts, nausea, darkening of the areolas, fatigue, headaches, bloating, mood swings, a metallic taste in the mouth, and changes in appetite, says Dr. Acevedo.",

Common early pregnancy symptoms include sore breasts, cramping, nausea, and fatigue. \n \n Of course, many early pregnancy symptoms overlap with common PMS symptoms, which can make the days leading up to your expected period full of questions.

Ahead, learn more about the early signs of pregnancy and what they might mean. Sore breasts are common in very early pregnancy. Breasts swell and begin to feel sore due to fluctuations in hormones. Your breasts may be extra tender as early as one or two weeks after conception. Many people understandably mistake cramping, pelvic discomfort, and backaches during early pregnancy for PMS symptoms.

It's a question Jane van Dis, M.D., an OB-GYN and the medical director at Maven Clinic, a women's and family health care company, regularly hears from patients.  There's a gray area after the implantation of a fertilized egg and before the body starts to alert the woman that she's pregnant,  says Dr. van Dis. \n \n If you're trying to get pregnant, knowing your menstrual cycle is key in calculating when you're most likely to conceive, when you've missed your period, and when you can reasonably expect an accurate pregnancy test result. But even if you're unsure, there are some signs of pregnancy you can experience even before a missed period, though they may not be as helpful as you think. \n \n Keep reading to learn more about what early signs of pregnancy you may be able to feel before a missed period, and how likely you are to experience them.  It's only when a fertilized egg attaches to the uterine wall that the body can even start to ramp up hormonal changes that preclude symptomatic changes,  says Dr. van Dis. On average, a person of childbearing age will ovulate between day 10 and day 14 of their cycle (though depending on the length of the cycle, it can vary widely), and implantation into the uterine wall typically happens six to 12 days after fertilization. That means a person with a typical cycle who's recently conceived may not see the first sign of pregnancy until 26 days after their last period. \n \n Some people will experience classic early pregnancy symptoms by day 26 of their cycle, including fatigue, sore or tender breasts, and nausea. But these symptoms are tricky because they can easily be mistaken for signs of PMS, especially if they occur before a missed period. \n \n  Depending on the [person] and the number of fetuses being carried, most pregnancy symptoms will present themselves within the first six weeks,  says Kecia Gaither, M.D., MPH, FACOG, double board-certified in OB-GYN and director of perinatal services at NYC Health and Hospitals, Lincoln.",

    desc: "Successfully conceiving often means timing sex so that sperm can reach an egg. There are four phases of the menstrual cycle (menstruation, the follicular phase, ovulation, and the luteal phase), and while each one is important for reproduction, your chances of conceiving differ in each one. The key player for successful conception is ovulation, which happens when a mature egg has been released from an ovary. The egg lives for approximately 24 hours in the reproductive tract. On the other hand, sperm can live for up to five days under the right conditions. This means that most people can conceive for about six days during each menstrual cycle—the five days before ovulation and one day afterwards. So can you get pregnant if you are not ovulating? And what are the chances of conceiving during each phase of the menstrual cycle? Keep reading for more about your menstrual cycle, ovulation, and fertility. Welcome to the prime time for pregnancy! Your  fertile window  spans from the five days before ovulation to one day afterwards. That is because sperm can survive for five days in the reproductive tract, while the egg survives for 24 hours, and it's possible for days-old sperm to fertilize a newly released egg. If you're trying to conceive, it's ideal to have sex multiple times in the days before, during, and just after ovulation. Given the wide range of cycle lengths knowing when you ovulate isnt as simple as looking at the calendar or counting cycle days. In fact, it can be near impossible to pinpoint exactly when ovulation occurs without an extremely well-timed ultrasound—but thankfully, that level of preciseness isn't necessary to conceive.",

Readings should be taken at the same time every day, immediately upon waking, after several hours of consistent sleep. It should be measured before eating, drinking, or any other activity. \n \n In addition, she says a BBT thermometer, which is accurate to the 1/10th degree, should be used. These kinds of thermometers can be found at a typical drugstore. \n \n When BBT temperature tracking is done, accurate results are dependent on very consistent measurements every day,  Dr. Kroener explains, pointing out that changes in temperature during ovulation are typically very small.",
